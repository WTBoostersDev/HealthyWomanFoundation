###About
====================
The Healthy Woman Foundation is a non-governmental organization dedicated to empowering and educating African women, notably those living in rural areas.
This NGO was founded by Sapphire ladies (Group 4) in Tech4Dev 2.4 cohort (Software Development). We believe that empowering women with health information will reduce morbidity and mortality while also promoting good health and well-being among all members of society.

###Problem Statement
=====================
Women and girls deal with a variety of health issues throughout their lives. Every minute of every day, a woman dies as a result of pregnancy and childbirth problems. According to studies, 95% of these women live in developing countries in Africa and Asian regions. These deaths could have been avoided if women had access to family planning services, prenatal care, and medical aid during childbirth, among others.
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa, with HIV/AIDS being the most common. Women make up about 58% of people with the infection. According to research, teenage girls are five times more likely than boys their age to be HIV-positive.

Though HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality predominate, non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and hypertension are the leading causes of death in older African women. 
Women are the foundation of families and communities, and health issues affecting women ultimately affect society.

###Vision:
====================
We seek to build a community that empowers girls and women to make healthier choices and take more control over health-related decisions.

###Mission:
====================
The Healthy Women Foundation strives to give women a forum for learning about health issues, donate supplies like menstrual kits to teenage girls in rural and urban areas, and work with policymakers and key stakeholders to enhance the standard of care that women receive.

###Plan
=====================
1. Create an easily accessible and navigable website that provides blog posts, videos, and occasional online conferences to educate and empower women.
2. Conduct health outreach initiatives in remote communities with skilled health professionals to screen for non-communicable diseases such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, and hypertension and make a referral to appropriate treatment facilities.
3. Give teenagers more information about their reproductive health, while also providing items such as books and menstruation kits.
4. Work together with policymakers and community stakeholders to enhance the standard of women's healthcare.
